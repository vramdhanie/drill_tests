# Unit Testing Drills
This project consist of a set of test for the following class.

![StringHelper Class](/docs/drills_3_string.png)

Create the class and implement the methods such that all tests pass.

## Requirements
 - Java 8 or higher
 - Gradle 

## Instructions
Clone the repository then run:

```
gradle build
```

This should fail since the StringHelper class does not yet exists.

After creating the class run:

```
gradle test
```

or use VScode test runner to run the tests.
